The **Original Garden Bed (OG)** was the properties only produce bearing garden bed upon arrival of **ii Ltd**. We will keep this garden bed and continue to monitor, test, and develop here on smaller scale items. Once we have achieved results that we want to replicate on a larger scale, we will move our knowledge and findings to the larger Terraced Garden Beds. 

We have had some good results with the majority of the garden here and are testing a few of the individual planter bins for variations between them. We will test things such as PH, moisture holding capability, mineral compositions, light exposure etc.
