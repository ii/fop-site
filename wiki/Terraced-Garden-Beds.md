# Terraced Garden Beds

The Terraced Garden Beds will become our main producing gardens here at the FoP. Below will be links to each individual garden bed along with frequently updated photos and information.

We have altered the original design as to preserve access to the back of the FoP. The garden beds have been shaped in more of a right angle shape with far less curve.

We have lost room for a garden bed or 2, but we feel this will pay off with the ease of access to the rest of the FoP.
