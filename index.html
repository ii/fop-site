      <h1>The Forest of Plenty</h1>
      <section>
      <p>
        The Forest of Plenty (FoP) is a part of <strong><a href='https://ii.nz/'>ii
        Limited</a></strong>, an international software cooperative specialising in the
        design and development of automated and continuous integration software.
      </p>
      <p>
        This land where the FoP is located (Tauranga, New Zealand) will be a test bed
        for new software and hardware that will help monitor soil, seed, plant, and tree
        development. Any area where software or hardware could be developed to help
        automate the care, growth, and monitoring of the property is of great interest.
        These ideas may become world leading technology to help automate food
        production, minimise food wastage or spoiling, and make it easier to grow high
        quality produce for all who source the open technology. This technology will
        contribute to mitigating the food shortages around the world by being adaptable
        to different climates, soil compositions, altitudes, and reducing possible
        produce spoilage from unforeseen draughts and storms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an exciting opportunity for the community to have its fingerprint on
        world changing software development. These developments and beta testing could
        impact millions of people around the world, help the planet through reducing
        commercial fertiliser use, increase environmental diversities, and encourage the
        return of flourishing ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FoP is working towards entering the world of the <a href='https://osseeds.org/'>Open Seed Source Initiative (OSSI)</a>. OSSI has
        three interconnected objectives. First, OSSI is a new way to save and exchange
        seed that ensures the seed will remain free of patents, licenses, and other
        restrictions on freedom to use. This method of exchange involves commitment to
        an open source seed Pledge. Second, OSSI maintains a list of crop varieties that
        have been pledged as “freed seed” and provides a link to sources of seed for
        those varieties. Third, OSSI works to raise awareness of the importance of
        keeping seeds unencumbered from legal restrictions and free to be used, shared,
        saved, bred, and sold.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSSI also helps to maintain a diverse ecosystem of plants and produce that
        all have individual benefits and requirements. This helps to stop the ever
        tightening circle around what seeds are commercially available to the public
        through the control enforced by a few world wide companies.
      </p>

        Below is the current design plans for the Forest of Plenty (FoP). There have
        been a few updates in regards to how the layout of the features are positioned
        and some planting position changes. These will be added as individual tickets in
        regards to each amendment under the milestone:
